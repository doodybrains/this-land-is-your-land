    This land is your land This land is my land
    From California to the New York island; 
    From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters 
    This land was made for you and Me.
    
        This type is your type This type is my type
        From Roboto Bold to FireSans Light
        From Open Sans Condensed to Ubuntu Regular
        This type was made for you and me.
        
    As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 
    I saw above me that endless skyway: 
    I saw below me that golden valley: 
    This land was made for you and me.

        As I was typing this series of texts, 
        I kept on looking at the fonts on Google: 
        I wished I knew of a better place but: 
        This type was made for you and me.

    I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 
    To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; 
    And all around me a voice was sounding: 
    This land was made for you and me.

        I followed my searches To a site called Typewolf
        Where they have a PDF called The Guide to Free Fonts
        but you have to buy it, it costs thirty nine dollars
        This type was made for you and me.

    When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, 
    And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, 
    As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: 
    This land was made for you and me.

        The font Futura, made in nineteen twenty seven, 
        was meant to carry us society
        its used in logos, like Dominos Pizza but
        this is the free version for you and me.




    stop?

    As I went walking I saw a sign there 
    And on the sign it said "No Trespassing." 
    But on the other side it didn't say nothing, 
    That side was made for you and me.

        As I went walking I saw a sign there 
        And on the sign it said "No Trespassing." 
        But on the other side it didn't say nothing, 
        That side was made for you and me.

    In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,
    By the relief office I seen my people; 
    As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking 
    Is this land made for you and me?

        there's a typeface called lexicon, it is a serif
        i would have used it, but its really expensive
        it costs three hundred and ninety one dollars
        is this type made for you and me?

    Nobody living can ever stop me, 
    As I go walking that freedom highway; 
    Nobody living can ever make me turn back 
    This land was made for you and me.
    
        Nobody living can ever stop me, 
        As I go walking that freedom highway; 
        Nobody living can ever make me turn back 
        This land was made for you and me.
